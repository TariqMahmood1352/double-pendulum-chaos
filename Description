When Geometry Becomes Chaos: The Double Pendulum 🌀📐

What looks like a random, chaotic dance is actually ruled by exact mathematics.
This system is the poster child of Chaos Theory: the double pendulum.

What’s happening under the hood?

🔹 1. Energy-based mechanics
Instead of forces, we describe the system using the Lagrangian:
L = T − V
where T is kinetic energy and V is potential energy.
The motion follows from the Euler–Lagrange equation (in compact form):
d/dt(∂L/∂θ̇) − ∂L/∂θ = 0

🔹 2. Coupled geometry
The system is defined by two angles, θ₁ and θ₂.
Because the second mass hangs from the first, its position depends on both angles:

x₂ = L₁ sinθ₁ + L₂ sinθ₂

y₂ = −L₁ cosθ₁ − L₂ cosθ₂

🔹 3. Why chaos emerges
The equations of motion are:

Coupled (each arm affects the other)

Non-linear (terms like sin(θ₁ − θ₂) and θ̇² appear)

This leads to sensitive dependence on initial conditions:
a change as small as 0.00001° in the starting angle produces a completely different trajectory within seconds.

🔑 The takeaway
The system is deterministic (fully rule-based), yet unpredictable in the long term.

That paradox is the essence of chaos.
